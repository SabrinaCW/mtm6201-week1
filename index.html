            Collaborative and supportive are words connected with my professional and personal profile. I am seeking to facilitate people's interaction with the media, prioritizing listening and observing human behavior. With a degree in Psychology, the way I connect with people and understand their needs helps me to be able to join with this ambiguous and technological world.
        </p>
        <p> Experience in human development projects within organizations, research and analysis of culture, and
            development of content for leadership and management of teams in small and large organizations. Always looking to develop myself and meet people and cultures, I like to learn from people and stories.
